This is a personal toolkit collection. Why did I build so many features I don’t always use? Why spend countless nights maintaining features I may not need? (Reflection.) While I use it for myself, I also share it in case it helps others with similar needs.

All modules are open-source.

If you have technical skills, clone the repo and modify it yourself. If you don't, clone the repo and ask an AI to help modify it.

Note: Because this is a personal-use plugin, there may be imperfections and even data loss risks (it uses APIs that operate on SiYuan data). Please test carefully before using. If you encounter issues, report them.
If you mind potential risks, please do not use it.

Currently for my own use...

Free users: if you encounter problems, don't report them unless they affect my personal use — I’ll fix bugs that affect me. If a bug persists over several releases, please fork and fix it yourself. If you donated, you can report bugs and I'll try to prioritize them. You can also request personal features — if they're simple I might implement them.

To facilitate communication with donors, I created a temporary feedback QQ group (may be dissolved anytime). Please fill in the application form before joining: https://www.kdocs.cn/wo/sl/v1lC0R0

Available features (see plugin demos and tutorials at https://ld246.com/search?q=sttools):
1. Interconnected schedule management: deeply integrates with SiYuan to provide calendar and kanban views, generate .ics calendar files for syncing with calendar apps via URL subscription (Thunderbird, Xiaomi Calendar, Apple Calendar, etc.), and basic integration with TickTick. (Demo and tutorials linked in the original README.)
2. Docker sync awareness: Windows S3 synchronization is detected by the Docker side.
3. AI web sidebar: embeds several AI web pages for convenient use.
4. Media compression: compress media before importing into SiYuan.
5. tldraw whiteboard: similar to AFFINE, tightly integrated with SiYuan. Supports embedding SiYuan blocks and link navigation.
6. Lifelog: open-source alternative (for a better experience, consider YeGui plugin). Implemented via PR by BoysFight.
7. WPS integration: embed, preview, edit, and sync office files in SiYuan; import spreadsheet-like data and upload images.
8. Aggregation queries: visual SQL builder to query the SiYuan database with multiple filters and sorting, preview results and embed them as blocks; visual chart generator based on DB/SQL queries.
